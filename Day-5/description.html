        <dd>The Nissan Skyline GT-R (Japanese: 日産・スカイラインGT-R, Hepburn: Nissan Sukairain GT-R) is a Japanese sports car based on the Nissan Skyline range.
             The first cars named "Skyline GT-R" were produced between 1969 and 1972 under the model code KPGC10, and were successful in Japanese touring car racing events.
             This model was followed by a brief production run of second-generation cars, under model code KPGC110, in 1973.</dd>
